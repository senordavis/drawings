I was born a doodler. There is no end to the number of stories that can be told of how when I was young, I colored on walls, on paper scraps, sidewalks, or anything that was available.

I chose to refine these doodles with a Bachelors of Fine Arts degree from Michigan State University. While studying art and design I created my first avatars for my wife and myself, that can only be described as caricatures. 

After countless friends begged for their own face, and my children discovered that I could create personal fantasy worlds for them, I'm finally ready to let my artwork be seen and purchased.

You can hang an original M.Davis drawing in your home, or have a personalized avatar created for you to use as your profile picture on facebook, twitter or anywhere else.

For something truly personalized, have your avatar drawn into a background of your choice, either one that already exists or a brand new one that you commission.

All of the artwork is hand drawn and then converted into a digital vector illustration. This ensures that your piece will always print to the highest quality no matter the size. Digital artwork is created on an iPad, using Inkpad, a Mac using Illustrator, or a combination of both.
